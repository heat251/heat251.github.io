<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SERVER RULES</strong></span></h1>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>If a rule is not explicitly stated, it can still be implicitly enforced. Use common sense.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Server admins have the final say on rule interpretation.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>No RDM (Random Deathmatch). You must have proof in order to kill someone. RDMing a traitor is still RDM.</li>
<li>No revenge RDM. Report the player and accept the admin ruling.</li>
<li>You will be held responsible for calling KOS (Kill On Sight) without proof that results in RDM.</li>
<li>Do not fill out false or blank RDM reports. You will get a warning and be slain all subsequent times.</li>
<li>No traitor baiting (eg: shooting randomly, destroying testers, saying you are a traitor).</li>
<li>No ghosting; If you are dead, stay quiet if using Discord.</li>
<li>Do not call KOS (Kill On Sight) based on location or weapon.</li>
<li>Prop killing is RDM unless a prop duel is accepted.</li>
<li>No bug abuse/exploits. (eg: going out of map bounds)</li>
<li>Incendiary grenades can be thrown at others as long as they are warned and are physically able to leave the target area.&nbsp;</li>
<li>You do not have to listen to anything a detective or innocent tells you to do but keep in mind it will be seen as very suspicious. However, they cannot kill you for disobeying.</li>
